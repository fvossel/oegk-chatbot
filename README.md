# OEKG-Chatbot

A GPT-powered chatbot for exploring and querying the [Open Energy Knowledge Graph (OEKG)](https://openenergyplatform.org/) from the Open Energy Platform (OEP).

This chatbot enables users to ask natural language questions about OEKG data and receive answers backed by SPARQL queries, using modern language models as reasoning engines.

## üöÄ Getting Started

### 1. Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/oekg-chatbot.git
cd oekg-chatbot
```

### 2. Install Requirements

We recommend using a **Python 3.10+ virtual environment**:

```bash
python -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate   # On Windows: .venv\Scripts\activate
pip install --upgrade pip
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### 3. Configure OpenAI and OEP Credentials

```bash
export OPENAI_API_KEY="sk-..."
```
Modify the .toml file at `.streamlit/secrets.toml` with:

```toml
oep_username = "YOUR_OEP_USERNAME"
oep_password = "YOUR_OEP_PASSWORD"
```

> **Note:** If you do not provide OEP credentials, the app will load a public (possibly outdated) OEKG snapshot from GitHub.

### 4. Prepare Resources

Ensure these files are present (or update their paths in the configuration as needed):

- `logo.svg`
- Knowledge graph index/resources

### 5. Run the Chatbot App

```bash
streamlit run streamlit_app.py --server.port 80
```

The app should open in your browser at `http://localhost:80`.
